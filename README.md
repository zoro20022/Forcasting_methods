Setup and Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iTransformer.git
cd iTransformer
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the iTransformer implementation)
Install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow jupyter
Run the download-data.sh script to download the dataset:

bash
Copy code
bash download-data.sh
This will download the electricity.npy dataset and save it in the project directory.

Dataset
Electricity Dataset
The electricity dataset (electricity.npy) contains historical electricity consumption data, which is commonly used for time-series forecasting tasks. This data allows the model to learn consumption patterns over time.

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook iTransformer.ipynb
Follow the steps provided in the notebook to train and evaluate the iTransformer model. The notebook provides detailed instructions on how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the model.


Evaluate the model's performance using the provided evaluation metrics. The notebook includes visualizations and analysis of the results.

Model Overview
The iTransformer model is an advanced neural network architecture specifically tailored for time-series forecasting. It uses self-attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies in the data, making it a powerful tool for predicting future values based on historical patterns.


Results
After training the iTransformer model, you can analyze the prediction results included in the notebook. The visualizations and performance metrics provide insights into how well the model performs on the given dataset.
